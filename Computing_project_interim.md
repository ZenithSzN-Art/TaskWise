Chapter 1: Introduction
Background Information
User experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design are crucial aspects of modern software development. These disciplines focus on optimizing usability, accessibility, and interaction design to enhance the user’s overall experience. As digital products become increasingly central to daily life, the effectiveness of their design in maintaining user engagement is of paramount importance.
One of the most used digital tools today is the to-do list app, which helps individuals and teams manage tasks efficiently. To-do list applications have evolved from simple checklist tools to complex productivity solutions incorporating features such as reminders, collaborative functionality, and AI-based task prioritization. However, despite the availability of numerous to-do list applications, user engagement remains a significant challenge. Many users abandon these apps after a short period due to poor UX/UI design, which negatively affects usability and motivation.
The intersection of UX/UI design and user engagement has gained increased attention in recent years. Studies indicate that aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and responsive interfaces contribute to prolonged user interaction. Conversely, cluttered, confusing, or poorly designed interfaces often lead to user frustration and decreased app retention. This study seeks to explore how UX/UI design influences user engagement in to-do list applications, identifying key design elements that contribute to enhanced user retention and usability.
Statement of the Problem
Despite the proliferation of to-do list applications, many fail to sustain user engagement over time. Several studies have highlighted the impact of UX/UI design on application success, yet there is limited research focusing specifically on to-do list applications. Users frequently report issues such as cluttered interfaces, lack of customization, poor responsiveness, and cognitive overload, which hinder productivity and lead to disengagement.
Given the growing reliance on productivity tools, understanding the role of UX/UI in engagement is essential. Without optimized UX/UI, users may abandon an application in Favor of competitors, resulting in decreased adoption rates and diminished effectiveness of task management solutions. This study aims to bridge the gap in understanding the relationship between UX/UI and user engagement in to-do list applications, providing insights that can guide better design practices.
Issues Identified
Through preliminary research and user feedback analysis, the following issues have been identified in existing to-do list applications:
1.	Complex Navigation: Many applications overwhelm users with excessive options, making task management cumbersome rather than efficient.
2.	Lack of Personalization: Users prefer applications that adapt to their individual needs, but many apps offer limited customization.
3.	Poor Visual Hierarchy: Information overload and unclear categorization can make task tracking difficult.
4.	Low Aesthetic Appeal: Outdated or unappealing interfaces can deter users from frequent engagement.
5.	Notification Fatigue: Overuse of notifications and alerts can lead to user frustration and app abandonment.
6.	Limited Cross-Device Synchronization: Users expect seamless task management across multiple devices, yet some apps fail to deliver a smooth experience.
7.	Accessibility Issues: Some applications do not prioritize inclusive design, making them difficult to use for individuals with disabilities.

Chapter 2 – Literature Review: UX/UI Design and User Engagement in To-Do List Applications: A Literature Review
UX/UI Principles: Usability, Accessibility, Interaction, Color, Typography
Usability: Usability refers to how effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily a user can achieve goals in a product. High usability means the app is easy to learn and use, enabling users to complete tasks with minimal effort or errors. In to-do apps, good usability might include intuitive task entry, clear organization, and responsive performance.
Accessibility: Accessibility ensures users of all abilities can use the interface. An accessible design allows people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments to navigate and understand the UI. This involves features like sufficient color contrast for text, support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and captions or alt text. Prioritizing accessibility not only benefits users with disabilities but often improves overall usability for everyone (e.g. high-contrast text is easier to read in sunlight).
Interaction Design: Interaction design focuses on designing the interactive behaviors between the user and the app. It is essentially about making sure users can achieve their objectives in the best possible way when using the product. This includes the layout of controls, feedback (like button responses or animations), and the flow of using features. For to-do apps, good interaction design might involve swipe gestures to complete or postpone tasks, drag-and-drop to reorder items, and immediate visual feedback when a task is checked off.
Color Theory: Color choices in UI design can have psychological effects on users. Research shows that colors significantly impact mood and perception – for example, warm colors like red or orange can evoke excitement or urgency, while cool colors like blue or green tend to be calming. In productivity apps, designers use color to draw attention to important elements (like a red “Add Task” button) or to categorize and prioritize tasks (e.g. color-coded labels or projects). Understanding color psychology helps in creating an emotional connection and guiding user behavior through the interface. Importantly, designers must also consider color contrast and avoid color combinations that are hard to distinguish (especially for color-blind users) to maintain accessibility.
Typography: Typography (the style and arrangement of text) is a fundamental element of UX design. Clear, legible typography ensures users can read information easily, directly affecting usability. Good typography in a to-do app means using fonts and text sizes that are easy on the eyes, establishing hierarchy (e.g. larger or bolder text for headings like “Today” or list names), and maintaining consistency. Designers often limit the number of typefaces to avoid visual clutter – too many fonts can confuse users and hinder a good user experience (The UX Designer’s Guide to Typography | IxDF). Ultimately, effective typography makes content readable, accessible, and understandable, directly contributing to a positive user experience.
UX Design in Productivity Apps: Why Engagement Depends on Design
User experience (UX) design is especially critical in productivity applications like to-do list apps. These tools need to help users stay organized and motivated rather than introduce friction. A well-designed UI/UX can significantly boost user engagement: good UI/UX design improves user satisfaction, engagement, and retention. When an app is enjoyable and easy to use, people are more likely to keep using it regularly to manage their tasks. On the other hand, poor UX can drive users away – 88% of users are less likely to return to a product after a bad user experience.
In the context of to-do apps, a UX-optimized application will streamline workflows (quickly adding a task, sorting it, marking it complete, etc.) and minimize distractions. Productivity apps should reduce the cognitive effort needed to use them so that users can focus on their actual tasks. A cluttered or confusing interface can lead to frustration, whereas a clean and logical design keeps users engaged and “in the flow” of their task management. In practice, this means features like easy drag-and-drop scheduling, clear visual organization of task lists, and helpful prompts (like reminders or smart suggestions) which all contribute to an app that users find effective and even enjoyable. Many companies realize that investing in UX for these tools is not just about aesthetics – it directly correlates with productivity and whether the app becomes a long-term part of the user’s routine ( The Impact of UI/UX Design on User Engagement and Retention ).
UX/UI in Leading To-Do List Apps: Case Studies
To illustrate the impact of UX/UI on engagement, we review design elements of three leading to-do list applications – Todoist, Microsoft To-Do, and Google Tasks – and how their design choices affect usability and user retention.
Todoist
Todoist is a popular cross-platform to-do list app known for its clean design and powerful features. Consistency and ubiquity are key parts of Todoist’s UX: it’s available on web, desktop, and mobile, which means users can access their tasks anywhere and any time. The design ensures a seamless experience across devices – for example, a user can add tasks on their phone offline and Todoist will sync the changes when internet is available, working as smoothly offline as it does online (Todoist, reviewed. An in-depth analysis of Todoist’s… | by Jay Miles | Bootcamp | Medium). This reliability in different contexts (online/offline, mobile/desktop) keeps users engaged because the app is dependable whenever a thought or task needs capturing.
Todoist’s interface is minimalist yet functional, using a lot of white space and simple icons. The “Today” view greets users with a list of tasks due today and uses familiar icons (like a + button or a check circle) without excessive labels, leveraging universal symbols to keep the UI uncluttered (Todoist, reviewed. An in-depth analysis of Todoist’s… | by Jay Miles | Bootcamp | Medium). To enhance engagement, Todoist incorporates gamification through a feature called Todoist Karma. Karma awards points for completing tasks, meeting daily or weekly goals, and using advanced features. Users can track their productivity progress in colorful charts and achieve higher “karma levels” as they use the app (Karma, a powerful way to track productivity). This gamified element taps into motivation psychology – it rewards users for consistent use and gives a sense of accomplishment, which can encourage habit formation (i.e. coming back each day to maintain a streak). By combining a straightforward UI with motivating feedback loops, Todoist’s design keeps users both satisfied and incentivized to engage regularly.
Microsoft To-Do
Microsoft To-Do (now integrated as Microsoft To Do) is Microsoft’s task management app, born from the acquisition of Wunderlist. Its UX emphasizes daily planning and integration with the Microsoft ecosystem. A standout design element is the “My Day” feature, which provides a fresh, empty canvas every day for the user’s tasks. Each day, users start with a clean slate where they can add their most important to-dos for that day without distraction (A Closer Look at Microsoft To Do, Lists, & Planner for Task Management | Classes Near Me Blog). This design approach aligns with productivity best practices – it helps users focus on a manageable list of tasks and prevents feeling overwhelmed by the entire task backlog. The app also offers an Intelligent Suggestions function (via a lightbulb icon) that recommends tasks from previous days or other lists to add to My Day, based on pending or upcoming due items (A Closer Look at Microsoft To Do, Lists, & Planner for Task Management | Classes Near Me Blog) (A Closer Look at Microsoft To Do, Lists, & Planner for Task Management | Classes Near Me Blog). By surfacing relevant tasks, the UI guides the user in planning their day, reducing the mental effort to decide what to work on next.
In terms of UI style, Microsoft To-Do uses a simple list-based layout with options to categorize tasks into lists and to set reminders or due dates. It integrates with Office 365, so flagged emails in Outlook or tasks in Planner can appear in To-Do – an example of UX consistency across services. The design uses cloud syncing, which means whether a user updates a list on their phone or work PC, their tasks stay up-to-date on all devices (A Closer Look at Microsoft To Do, Lists, & Planner for Task Management | Classes Near Me Blog). Microsoft To-Do also allows slight personalization (e.g. background themes for lists, including a dark mode and colorful headers) to make the experience more personal and visually pleasing. Overall, Microsoft To-Do’s UX/UI design focuses on keeping users engaged by encouraging a daily planning ritual (clear daily focus) and making task management feel integrated with their overall digital workflow.
Google Tasks
Google Tasks is Google’s minimalist to-do list app, available on web (as a sidebar in Gmail/Calendar) and mobile. Its design philosophy leans heavily into simplicity and minimalism. The interface is very clean – essentially just a list of tasks with the ability to indent subtasks, add due dates, and check items off. This minimal UI carries the benefit of being straightforward: new users can understand how to add or complete tasks with almost no learning curve. Tasks created in one Google product (say Gmail) are instantly available in others (Calendar, mobile app) due to tight integration and syncing across the Google ecosystem (Case study: Google tasks redesign | by Diogo Stein | Bootcamp | Medium). This integration supports engagement for users already in Google’s apps by keeping tasks in view alongside emails and calendar events, ensuring to-dos aren’t forgotten.
However, the ultra-simplified design of Google Tasks has also been a point of criticism in terms of engagement and long-term satisfaction. Users have noted that the app’s feature set is too limited and the UI feels “outdated and unattractive”, lacking capabilities that power users expect (Case study: Google tasks redesign | by Diogo Stein | Bootcamp | Medium). Common pain points reported include difficulty organizing a large number of tasks (no advanced sorting or filtering), absence of features like task prioritization or tagging, no recurring reminders, and no collaborative list sharing (Case study: Google tasks redesign | by Diogo Stein | Bootcamp | Medium). In UX terms, while the low complexity interface reduces cognitive load, it may under-serve users’ needs, causing them to disengage over time in favor of more full-featured apps. Google’s choice to keep Tasks minimal is likely intended to appeal to casual users or those who only need a basic list, but it highlights a trade-off in UX design: simplicity vs. capability. As a result, Google Tasks’ UX receives praise for being clean and easy, but its limited UI elements and functionality can negatively impact user engagement for those who need more robust task management.
Psychological Principles in UI Design
Human psychology plays a crucial role in how users interact with an app’s UI. Good UX/UI design leverages psychological principles to reduce friction and make the experience intuitive. Key concepts include cognitive load, Hick’s Law, and Fitts’ Law, among others, which influence design decisions in productivity apps:
•	Cognitive Load: This refers to the amount of mental effort required to use the interface. When cognitive load is high, users may feel overwhelmed or confused, which impairs their ability to complete tasks (What is Cognitive Load? | IxDF). To-do applications aim to minimize cognitive load by keeping interfaces simple and familiar. For example, using standard icons (a plus sign for adding, a trash can for deleting) and predictable layouts means users don’t have to stop and think about how to perform actions – it’s obvious. Grouping related functions and using clear labels helps users mentally process information more easily. The overall goal is to avoid taxing the user’s short-term memory or decision-making with unnecessary complexity (Hick’s Law | Laws of UX). A low cognitive load translates to a smoother experience and higher engagement, because users can focus on their tasks rather than the tool itself.
•	Hick’s Law: Hick’s Law states that the more options or choices a user faces, the longer it takes them to make a decision (Hick’s Law | Laws of UX). In UI terms, if a menu or screen is packed with too many buttons or links, it will slow the user down and possibly frustrate them. To-do apps apply Hick’s Law by streamlining menus and keeping choices straightforward. For instance, rather than showing all possible sorting, filtering, sharing, and tagging options up front (which could be overwhelming), a well-designed app might show only the essentials on the main screen and hide advanced options in a secondary menu. By minimizing choices at critical moments, the design helps users quickly decide what to do (e.g., tap the one “add task” button, or select from a short menu of three filter options rather than 20). This principle is closely related to the mantra “Keep It Simple, Stupid” (K.I.S.S.), emphasizing that simplicity in design makes it easier for users to proceed without getting stuck in decision paralysis (Hick’s Law: Making the choice easier for users | IxDF) (Hick’s Law: Making the choice easier for users | IxDF).
•	Fitts’ Law: Fitts’ Law describes how the time to acquire a target (like clicking a button) is a function of the target’s size and distance. In practical terms: bigger or closer targets are faster to click, while small or far targets are harder (Fitts's Law and Its Applications in UX). UI designers use this principle by making important buttons (such as “Add Task” or “Save”) large and placing them in easy-to-reach areas of the screen. For example, many mobile to-do apps use a big circular “+” button at the bottom corner – it’s large and within a thumb’s reach, so adding a task is fast. Conversely, if a tap target is tiny (like a small checkbox) or placed awkwardly (like a corner that’s hard to hit), users will take longer and may miss the target, reducing efficiency. In line with Fitts’ Law, some apps also utilize the edges and corners of screens for essential controls because those areas can be accessed quickly (on desktop, the corners of the screen are effectively “infinitely” easy to hit with a mouse). By adhering to Fitts’ Law, to-do list UIs can make interactions feel effortless and thus keep users more engaged and less frustrated by physical interface challenges.
In summary, incorporating these psychological principles – managing cognitive load, limiting options to speed decisions, and sizing/positioning interactive elements for easy access – leads to interfaces that “feel” intuitive. Productivity apps with such considerate designs enable users to add or complete tasks almost as a reflex, which is exactly the kind of fluid experience that drives continued engagement.
Emerging UX/UI Trends in Task Management Apps
The landscape of task management applications is continuously evolving. In the last few years, several UX/UI trends have emerged, aiming to improve user engagement and adapt to user preferences:
•	Minimalism: “Less is more” is a guiding philosophy for many modern apps. Minimalist UI design involves stripping interfaces down to essential elements, using ample white space, and focusing on clean, flat visuals. The benefit is reduced distraction – nothing extraneous competes for the user’s attention (Minimalism in Mobile App Design as a Powerful Сurrent Trend - Agilie). In to-do apps, minimalism can be seen in simple list layouts, hidden menus (revealed by a tap or swipe), and the use of subtle color accents instead of heavy graphics. This trend caters to users who want a quick, no-frills way to manage tasks. A minimalist design can also reduce cognitive load, as discussed earlier, by presenting only what’s needed at each step. Apps like Google Tasks embody minimalism (sometimes to a fault, as noted), whereas others offer a minimalist mode or default, ensuring broad appeal. The challenge with minimalism is balancing simplicity with functionality – successful designs find ways to maintain power for advanced users while keeping the primary UI uncluttered.
•	Gamification: To increase engagement, some task apps incorporate game-like elements. The idea is to make productivity fun by rewarding certain behaviors. Todoist’s Karma system is a prime example: completing tasks earns the user Karma points, which accumulate and unlock achievement levels (Karma, a powerful way to track productivity). Other apps might include streaks (e.g., “X days of tasks completed in a row”), badges for goals met, or even playful animations when you finish all tasks for the day. Gamification leverages users’ psychological reward systems – turning task completion into a satisfying feedback loop. This trend, when done judiciously, can motivate users to engage more frequently with the app (users might add more tasks or return daily to avoid “breaking the streak”). However, designers must ensure that the gamification features don’t overshadow productivity; they should remain an optional enhancement that complements the core task management experience.
•	Dark Mode: Dark mode has transitioned from a trend to an expected feature in modern apps. Dark mode UI presents light-colored text and elements on a dark background, which many users find reduces eye strain especially in low-light environments. It has been lauded for being easier on the eyes during nighttime use and for conserving battery on OLED screens (Dark Mode: A UI Trend That’s Here to Stay | by Consagoustech | Medium). All the leading to-do apps (Todoist, Microsoft To Do, Google Tasks) now offer a dark theme. The availability of dark mode also ties into accessibility and user preference – some people simply prefer the aesthetics of a dark interface. By providing both light and dark themes, apps allow users to choose what’s most comfortable, potentially increasing the time users are willing to spend in the app (e.g., planning tasks in bed at night with dark mode on). Dark mode is now considered a hallmark of good design practice, with major operating systems and apps supporting easy switching (Dark Mode: A UI Trend That’s Here to Stay | by Consagoustech | Medium).
•	AI-Assisted Task Management: The newest trend is the integration of artificial intelligence to make task management smarter and more automated. AI can help by suggesting tasks, prioritizing items, or even scheduling tasks for users. For example, some apps like Motion have introduced features where the app will automatically allocate tasks into your calendar, finding optimal time slots based on deadlines and priorities (13 Best To-Do List Apps 2025). This auto-scheduling or smart assistant approach uses algorithms to reduce the manual planning burden on the user. Additionally, AI chatbots or assistants can allow users to add tasks via natural language or get reminders and tips. In the coming years, we can expect to see to-do apps integrating AI to predict what a user might want to do next or to analyze a user’s productivity patterns and offer insights. The promise of AI in UX is to further reduce friction – if the app can take over some organizational chores (like shuffling your to-do list when a meeting pops up), users can remain engaged without feeling overwhelmed by constantly reorganizing their tasks. This trend is emerging, so design best practices are still forming, but it represents a significant shift toward more dynamic and personalized UX in productivity tools.
Incorporating these trends helps task management apps stay relevant and improve the user experience. Minimalism and dark mode cater to user preferences for visual comfort and focus; gamification taps into motivation; and AI assistance addresses efficiency and personalization. An app that successfully blends these elements can offer a state-of-the-art experience that keeps users engaged and loyal.
Designing a great UX/UI is an iterative process, and usability testing is crucial for evaluating how well an application meets user needs. Usability testing involves observing real users as they interact with the app to identify pain points and areas of confusion. To make these observations actionable, designers and researchers rely on user experience metrics – concrete measures that reflect the quality of the experience.
Common usability metrics include: success rate (can users complete a given task, like adding a new task, without errors?), time on task (how long it takes to finish a task, e.g. scheduling a reminder), error rate (how often users make mistakes, such as creating a duplicate task by accident), and subjective satisfaction (often captured by asking users to rate their experience) (Usability Metrics). These metrics provide a quantitative way to compare designs or track improvements. For instance, after a UI update, a team might find that the average time to set a due date dropped by 20%, indicating a more efficient design.
In addition to task-based metrics, researchers use standardized UX questionnaires to gauge overall satisfaction. One example is the System Usability Scale (SUS), a ten-item survey giving a score from 0–100 that reflects perceived usability. Another is the Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX), a four-item Likert scale that offers a quick measure of an app’s perceived usability ((PDF) The Usability Metric for User Experience - ResearchGate). These metrics are important in academic research and industry because they allow benchmarking. A to-do list application’s SUS score, for example, can be compared against industry averages or against scores of competitor apps to see where it stands.
When conducting usability tests for to-do apps, researchers often look at both quantitative data (like the metrics above) and qualitative feedback. Qualitative measures might include user interviews or open-ended survey questions to capture how users feel about the design (“Which part of managing your tasks did you find frustrating?”). Qualitative insights explain the “why” behind the numbers – for example, if error rates are high in adding tasks, interviews might reveal that the add-task button was hard to find (a navigation issue).
User experience metrics don’t exist in isolation; they feed back into design decisions. If testing shows low success rates for creating recurring tasks, designers know to revisit that workflow and simplify it. If satisfaction scores improve after introducing a dark mode option, it validates that the feature met a user need. Metrics also help prioritize fixes – a critical usability issue (like users unable to figure out how to edit a task) will manifest in poor test results and thus should be addressed before less critical tweaks.
Finally, analytics in a released app provide additional UX metrics: engagement metrics like daily active users, retention rate (how many users return month after month), and feature usage statistics (e.g. what percentage of users set due dates or use the reminder feature). These can highlight real-world usage patterns. For example, if an analytics dashboard shows that very few users use a multi-step feature (perhaps setting up a complex recurring task), it could imply that the feature is too hidden or too complicated – an area for UX improvement.
In summary, usability testing and UX metrics give designers empirical evidence of how UX/UI design affects user engagement. By continuously measuring and iterating, productivity apps can refine their interfaces to be more intuitive, efficient, and satisfying – ultimately leading to higher user engagement and a more successful product (Usability Metrics) (Usability Metrics).
